# SEQUENCE IS A ORDERED COLLECTION OF ELEMENTS
# IF THE SEQUENCE ISN'T ORDERED, WE COULDN'T REFER THESE ELEMENTS BY THEIR INDEX POSITION
# STRING, LIST and TUPLES ARE SEQUENCE
# STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE THAT MEANS THEY CANN'T BE CHANGES
# LISTS ARE MUTABLE, THAT MEANS THE VALUE CAN BE CHANGED

# DELETE THE ELEMENTS THAT ARE GREATER THAN 200 OR LESSER THAN 100
