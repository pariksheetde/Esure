1. Sequence is an ordered collection of items
2. The word `ordered` means the elements can be refered by the index position
3. In Python, anything that be iterated is iterable
4. All sequences can be iterated, like string, list, tuple
5. But, all iterables are not sequences. We can use for loop over dictionary, but dictionary is not sequence
